# Introduction

Welcome to the Wisetack API. You can use our API to seamlessly integrate point-of-sale financing into your existing application. 

We have language bindings in Shell, Ruby, Python, and Java.  You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.



# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'wisetack'

api = Wisetack::APIClient.authorize!('yourkeyhere')
```

```python
import wisetack 

api = wisetack.authorize('yourkeyhere')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: yourkeyhere"
```

> Make sure to replace `yourkeyhere` with your API key.

Wisetack uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Wisetack expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: yourkeyhere`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>yourkeyhere</code> with your personal API key.

# Transactions 

## Create a new transaction 

```ruby
require 'wisetack'

api = Wisetack::APIClient.authorize!('yourkeyhere')
api.merchants(ae544181-3cad-4604-a629-8141d74b9c31).transactions.post
```

```python
import wisetack 

api = wisetack.authorize('yourkeyhere')
api.merchants(ae544181-3cad-4604-a629-8141d74b9c31).transactions.post
```
