    ## Introduction
    Welcome to the Wisetack API. The APIs documented on this page will enable you to seamlessly integrate point-of-sale financing
    with your existing system.  Here's a brief overview of the APIs:

    * **CreateLinks** allow you to create an HTML link that can be embedded in an invoice. This link will initiate a lending session
    specific for that invoice.

    * **Transactions** allow you to intiate a loan for a specific merchant for a borrower based only on amount and phone number.
    Furthermore, transactions allow you to track and update the flow of the loan through authorization and settlement.

    * **Merchants** allow you to onboard merchants into the system as well as list your existing merchants based on
    date and status filters, get information on a merchant, and remove merchants from your system.

    * **Users** Allow you to add users for merchants. Each merchant can have multiple users for the Wisetack system. The Users resource allows you
    to add and manage users and their roles and priveleges in the system.

    ## Authentication
    Wisetack uses HTTP Basic Authentication with both an application token and a secret key. When you initially create
    a Wisetack account, you'll be given an application token and a secret key for both the production system
    and a test system.  You'll be able to distinguish between the two keys easily by their prefix. Production keys
    start with ws_prod_ and the test system keys are prefixed by ws_test_.
    If you use one of our language SDK's you don't need to worry about the specifics of authentication but if you
    want to build authentication in to your own RESTful calls, you simply add the keys to the header like this:

    1. Concatenate the application token and secret key separated by a colon.

    2. Base64 encode the resulting string.

    3. Pass the result in the authorization header, prefixed with the word Basic.

    This process will result in a header that looks something like this: \
    **Authorization: Basic ZHBERDZ6NG9sT1NJN040Zk1Dc0FsS2pGYTdyZUJZaHU6b0ptM25pUVgxUGR5NRNDU=**

      The Transaction resource initiates loan applications and manages the flow of loan authorization, settlement, and refunds.
  - name: Merchants
    description: |
      The Merchant resource allows you to onboard merchants over time, to delete merchants from your system,
      to list all merchants, and to get information on individual merchants.

      There are two very different types of data in the MerchantObject.

      * **Flag Fields** are essentially flags
      indicating to the client which fields need to be collected from the merchant. These flag fields are in
      MerchantOptionalInformation and MerchantDataRequired schemas. Their presence indicates that they
      must be collected.

      * **Data Fields** are string fields where the data collected in response to the Flag Fields above
      can be sent back to the server. These fields are in the MerchantUpdateObject.

      Additionally, there are four different flag field sections. Where a flag field is found (if at all)
      indicated how the client should behave regarding that field.

      * **optionalInformation** indicates that this information has not been collected. It is not required
      but could be helpful in future dealings with this merchant.

      * **currentlyDue** are the fields the merchant must supply to start or continue to provide
      lending services.

      * **eventuallyDue** are the fields the merchant must supply to have the full range of lending
      capabilities he is eligible for.

      * **pastDue** are the field the merchant must supply to continue or restore their lending
      capabilities.

  - name: Users
    description: |
      The Users resource allows you to support multiple users, each with their own roles and privileges in the
      Wisetack system. This feature allows merchants to add and manage employees and other types
      of subusers.

      You can use the createLink resource to create links that can be embedded in invoices or other materials where
      you might want to offer a loan to a specific customer. The createLink allows you to register information that will
      expedite the borrowing process for your merchant's existing customers. By sending information when creating this link,
      Wisetack can more easily pre-fill information and make the borrower's experience as smooth as possible.

        Creation of a link requires a transaction amount and loan purpose.  Optional fields such as customer address, dob,
        and ssn as well as optional line item information is also supported.. The POST returns a link that is specific for
        that customer, merchant, and line items. When the customer clicks the link, they will proceed to a lending flow specifically for
        them. A unique link will be created on each create. The link expires after 90 days.

      description: |
        The Wisetack lending system starts by sending a text message link from a merchant to a prospective borrower. The
        merchant must enter the mobile number of the borrower, a transaction amount, and the purpose of the loan and the
        text message is sent. Once the consumer clicks the link on their mobile phone, they will proceed to the
        Wisetack lending process.

        Note that the POST can also include an array of line items to describe the services or products provided as
        well as other optional items described in the TransactionObject. These line items
        are optional.
        The following values are required for the POST:

        * status must be set to 'initiated'.

        * a United States domestic mobile phone number is required.

        * a transaction amount is required.

        * a loan purpose is required.

        * Authorized: Wisetack has authorized the loan for this customer. The loan will not be made until the transaction status has been set to 'settled.' An authorized transaction can either be 'settled' or 'canceled'. An authorized transaction will expire after 30 days if it has not been settled.
        * Settled: Once the loan is settled, Wisetack will begin the loan and pay the merchant via ACH. Once a loan is settled, it can be either partially or completely refunded.
        * Refunded:  The full amount of the loan has been refunded.
        * Expired: The transaction was not authorized or settled under the specified time limit. A transaction can never be removed from an expired state.
        * Declined: The transaction was declined.
